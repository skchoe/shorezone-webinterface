<P>The Frog Finder was created by Seungkeol Choe (programming) and Jeff Rice (design and concept) and searches spatial data from the 2010 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Search results show intersections between GPS coordinates and 
echo "<a href=http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data>IUCN range maps</a>". 
In other words, if your location—or the location you have entered— falls within the boundaries of a range map for a particular species, this app will tell you. Support for the creation of this app was provided by the University of Utah J. Willard Marriott Library and the Western Soundscape Archive. Special thanks to AmphibiaWeb for allowing us to link to its worldwide amphibian database. Please contact us for more information.
